    <h1>Baking With Kevin</h1>

    <h2>Making Sourdough</h2>

    <pre>
    Due to the outrageous demands of about three people, I did another episode of Baking With Kevin, this time about
    sourdough and walking through my all-time favorite recipe (including the tweaks I’ve made to it over the years I’ve
    been making it).</pre>

    <pre>
    This was my first time trying out Facebook Live and other than the video being portrait, it wasn’t horrible. I could
    actually see peoples’ comments and questions as I was working, which was easier than the previous Google Meet-based
    (OK, totally calling it Meetspace from now on) episode. It’s still really weird essentially talking to myself.</pre>

    <pre> 
    posted these to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> event before I started the video, because the process takes so long, the only live
    demo part was dividing the dough and forming loaves. So, now you get to see them, and the video at the bottom! Lucky
    you.</pre>
